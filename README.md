Install using pip:

    python -m pip install pyaudio 

Notes:

    If pip is not already bundled with your installation of Python, get it here.
    pip will fetch and install PyAudio wheels (prepackaged binaries). Currently, there are wheels compatible with the official distributions of Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. For those versions, both 32-bit and 64-bit wheels are available.
    These binaries include PortAudio v19 [SVN r1960], built with MinGW. They support only the Windows MME API and do not include support for DirectX, ASIO, etc. If you require support for APIs not included, you will need to compile PortAudio and PyAudio.
